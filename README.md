# TODO

- [x] join adjacent runs and words on the same line, if they have the same styling
- [x] hyphenation of words
- [x] when joining adjacent runs, handle objects in between runs. also handle zero-width objects.
- [x] when adding dash to the end of hyphenated text, ignore invisible objects
- [x] word splitter has issue with space at end of run
- [x] optional hyphenation
- [x] if nothing fits on the line, try to hyphenate, and if that doesn't work, just overflow
- [x] should dashes be placed within the text?
- [x] test hyphenation and optional hyphenation
- [x] spacers alongside words and inline text interface
- [x] word break

- [x] section (multi-paragraph) formatter that handles multiple pages
